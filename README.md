<h1 align="center">MarketSpace</h1>

The MarketSpace app was created with the aim of understanding more about navigation with public and private routes, styling with component libraries, consumption of APIs and refresh tokens, API contexts and form validation and control in React Native. MarketSpace is an app where people can publish products/advertisements that they want to sell. During the development of the app, we sought to keep the code as clean as possible and follow the best possible rules.;
